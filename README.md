TODO

- For every Image, implement a carousel to display all picture and not only the first one
- Add search feature based on the name
- No pull to refresh based on Amazon design
- Improve caching by adding an expiration time (at the moment not needed as this is unlikely to be dynamic)
- Make FAB hidden when scrolling
