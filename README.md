TODO

- For every Image, implement a carousel to display all picture and not only the first one
- Add search feature based on the name
- No pull to refresh based on Amazon design
- Improve caching by adding an expiration time (at the moment not needed as this is unlikely to be dynamic)
- Make FAB hidden when scrolling
- The small number displayed near the category icon is the number of subcategories and not products
- Sorry but no Unit Tests, nor Functional Tests
- Have also the SharedPref accessed in background
- Remove both ViewModels to keep only one
- Give the possibility in the cart to reduce the number
- Optimize Styles in layout
- Add Swipe to delete in Cart Screen
